# solutions-raster-functions

Raster functions can be applied to raster datasets and mosaic datasets for fast, accurate analytic capabilities.  The raster functions published within this repo are for weather data and are for use with NAM CONUS 12km data in the NetCDF format which can be obtained from here http://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/.  The raster functions enable the user to take a multi variable meteorological data raster and extract and display single variables.  Examples would be extracting Temperature or Relative Humidity so that they can be viewed within ArcMAP.  Also included are some Python raster function which utilise Python scripts, which are provided, to calculate derived weather variable such as wind chill and heat index. The user can then by inputting parameters make predictions as to the impact these weather conditions may have on Military Operations.  These parameters can be changed to suit not just Military operations but any activity that may be influenced by the weather.

## Instructions

### General Help

* [New to Github? Get started here.](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/Esri/esri.github.com/blob/master/help/esri-getting-to-know-github.html)
* [Getting started with image and raster processing](http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/data/imagery/get-started-with-image-and-raster-processing.htm)
* [Apply functions to a dataset](http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/data/imagery/apply-functions-to-a-dataset.htm)


### Getting Started

* Download the solutions-raster-functions repo to your local computer and unzip it to a local drive location preferably route of C:
* Read information on building raster functions which can be found  here (https://github.com/Esri/raster-functions/wiki) and here (https://github.com/Esri/raster-functions) and here for Python raster functions here (https://github.com/Esri/raster-functions/wiki/PythonRasterFunction)
* Information on how to build / modify raster functions within ArcMAp can be found here (https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/desktop/latest/manage-data/raster-and-images/accessing-the-raster-function-template-editor.htm) and information for ArcGIS Pro can be found here (http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/data/imagery/apply-functions-to-a-dataset.htm)



* These raster functions are designed to work with mosaic datasets only and only with NAM data in the NetCDF format.  If the user wants to use other data formats then the raster functions and associated python scripts will have to be edited. 
* The raster functions have been built with NAM CONUS (12km) downloaded in the OpeNDAP format obtained from here (http://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/)  and then converted to NetCDF format using the OpeNDAP to NetCDF tool within the Multidimension Supplemental tools which can be downloaded from here (http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=9f963f362fe5417f87d44618796db938) For more information on the data downloaded please refer to here (http://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/txt_descriptions/WRF_NMM_doc.shtml)
* Raster functions should be applied as follows;
				* With ArcGIS Desktop 10.3
					* Add the raster functions to the mosaic dataset as processing templates.
					* Add mosaic dataset to project and then apply relevant processing template.
				* With ArcGIS Pro:
					* The Mosaic dataset needs to be within a database within the databases section.
					* The Set Mosaic Dataset Properties geoprocessing tool then needs to be run.
					* Under the Image Processing tab the Raster Functions should be added as Processing templates one by one.
					* To run them within ArcGIS Pro 1st select the layer you want apply it to from the table of contents then select Mosaic Layer - Data from the ribbon bar at the top and select the relevant Raster Function from the processing templates drop down.
					
* It is likely that you will want to use your own data and thresholds within these raster functions this can be done as follows;
				* To edit the thresholds open the raster function within the raster function editor and change the parameters within the remap function.  If you want to add more  levels of operational impact for an activity then also open and edit the statistics and histogram function.
				
				* To use your own data in a standard raster function the Definition Query within the Function Chain will have to edited to suit your data.  The function chain is accessed through the raster function editor.
				
				* To use your own data within a Python raster function the .py file has to be edited so the correct names are within the getParameterInfo function. Also within the raster function itself the variable names need to be corrected within the Variable Manager section of the Python Raster Function function.  Within the Function Chain section "Type" needs to be set to Item Group and the "Group Field Name" and "Tag Field Name" need to be set to appropriate values.  For more information on how to make your own Python Raster Functions please refer to (https://github.com/Esri/raster-functions/wiki/PythonRasterFunction)

* For further information on how to set up the test data / raster functions please refer to the Military Aspects of Weather (MAoW) template located here (URL OF MAoW TEMPLATE WHEN AVAILABLE)
					
## Resources

* [ArcGIS Pro](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/community/)
* [MAoW v2 Template] (http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=2bd5ab673e5d4374bca6343cc80df414)  - This may be of use as it is fully working example of the above raster functions with sample Map Packages.  Uses all the same functions are as presented in this repo. Also contains more detailed instructions on how the raster functions can be set up and changed to suit the users needs.
